## 📊 Workflow
1. Data cleaning and handling missing values  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visual insights  
3. Feature engineering (`is_family`, `total_nights`, `deposit_given`)  
4. Encoding categorical variables using Mean Encoding  
5. Handling outliers with log transformation  
6. Feature selection using LASSO  
7. Model training and evaluation using multiple algorithms  
8. Cross-validation for accuracy consistency
